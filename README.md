# Islamic Prayers Times
- It is a chrome extension that displays the times of islamic prayers
- It's my first try to create a chrome extension

- For now it displays the times of one city which is Cairo
- It uses the [aladhan.com API](https://aladhan.com/) to get prayers times
- The extension will updated to allow the user the get the times specific to each city by entering it's name
